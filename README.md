# Telle - a simple template for nice Telegram bots

This is a skeleton bot which can deal in web-server and standalone (cli) modes.
In cli mode it supports multiple worker-processes if it is needed for high-loaded sites.
Also it has its own cron sheduler which allows to start AbstractBackgroundProcess descendants as a part of cron process or in background (recomended for time consuming tasks)
## TODO
Now it seems nothing to do
